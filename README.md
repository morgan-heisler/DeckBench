This repository contains the official benchmark and evaluation code for **DECKBench**, a reproducible benchmark for **academic paper–to–slide generation and multi-turn slide editing**.

DECKBench evaluates the *full presentation workflow*, from converting long research papers into slide decks to iteratively refining those decks through natural-language editing instructions. The benchmark is designed for evaluating **LLM- and agent-based systems** under realistic, multi-turn conditions.

🧪 **Status**: KDD 2025 submission  
📦 **Release**: Post-submission / arXiv

## Overview

Preparing academic slide decks is an iterative, design-intensive process. Existing benchmarks typically evaluate either:
- one-shot text-to-slide generation, or
- isolated interface manipulation tasks.

DECKBench unifies these perspectives by introducing two tightly coupled tasks:

1. **Slide Generation**  
   Generate a complete academic slide deck from a full research paper.

2. **Multi-Turn Slide Editing**  
   Iteratively refine an existing slide deck in response to natural-language editing instructions.

The benchmark includes:
- curated paper–slide pairs
- simulated multi-turn editing trajectories
- reference-free and reference-based evaluation metrics
- layout and visual design heuristics

## Data Access and Licensing

### Important Note

**This repository does not redistribute conference papers or presentation slides.**

Due to licensing restrictions, we instead provide:
- metadata for each benchmark instance
- scripts to automatically retrieve publicly available PDFs and slides from official sources

Users are responsible for complying with the original licenses of the retrieved materials.

### Fetching the Data

```bash
python tools/fetch_data.py \
  --output_dir data/raw/
```

The script:

- downloads paper PDFs from official conference or author pages
- retrieves publicly hosted presentation slides when available
- validates checksums against benchmark metadata

---

## Task 1: Slide Generation
### Task Definition

#### Input
- Full academic paper (PDF or structured text)

#### Output
- A complete slide deck (HTML or PPTX)

The generated deck does not need to match the reference slides exactly in length or ordering.

### Evaluation Metrics

#### Slide-Level
- Textual similarity (embedding-based)
- Faithfulness to source paper
- Visual similarity (VLM-based)

#### Deck-Level
- Content coverage and grounding
- Narrative coherence and ordering (DTW-based)
- LLM-as-judge coherence and completeness
- Layout and visual quality metrics

#### Running Slide Evaluation

```
python scripts/run_evaluation.py \
  --model your_model_name \
  --split test \
  --output outputs/generation/
```
  ---
  

## Task 2: Multi-Turn Slide Editing
### Task Definition

#### Input (per turn)
- Current slide deck
- Natural-language editing instruction*

#### Output
- Updated slide deck

Editing is evaluated over multiple turns, reflecting realistic revision workflows.

#### Simulated Editing Traces

*Editing instructions are generated by a simulated user agent that compares intermediate decks against ground-truth final slides. 

Instructions vary in:
- verbosity
- specificity
- focus (content, layout, structure)

### Evaluation Metrics

#### Reference-Free
- Instruction-following accuracy (LLM-as-judge)
- Edit consistency and locality

#### Reference-Based
- Per-turn improvement toward reference deck
- DTW distance reduction
- Narrative alignment improvement across turns

#### Running Slide Editing & Evaluation
```
python scripts/run_editing.py \
  --model your_model_name \
  --split test \
  --output outputs/editing/
```

## Reproducibility

All experiments in the paper can be reproduced using:
- the provided benchmark splits
- deterministic evaluation scripts
- fixed LLM prompts and agent configurations

Random seeds, prompt templates, and configuration files are logged automatically.
